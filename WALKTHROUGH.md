Woodcrafting (Walkthrough)
============

**Please note that this walkthrough is currently under construction.**

This guide will walk you through crafting your first CrudeAxeHammer to building your first WoodcraftingStation to
making items on that station.

**During Game Creation**

* If you want an easier experience, enable the modules `InGameHelp` and `WorkstationInGameHelp`. This will allow you to
open up a help window (by pressing the `P` key by default) that shows most of the items available, as well as how to
craft them.
* Make sure to choose the `NeoTTA` world generator during game creation. This worldgen is accessible by enabling the
`NeoThroughoutTheAges` module. Otherwise, you will not be able to acquire all the necessary items outlined below (such
as sticks, twigs, and the correct logs), or in future modules down the line. If you still choose to use another worldgen,
use the `get` command in the console to acquire the inaccessible items.

**First Steps / NatureCrafting**

* Gather stones by digging up dirt (50% chance to obtain 1 stone), and breaking stone blocks (3 stones per block).
You'll need at least 3 of them. Make sure to use non-shovel tools, as using those will only drop dirt blocks.
    * While digging up blocks, you may gather some flint. This can be used for crafting stone knives as well as converting
    unlit torches into lit ones.
* Gather sticks and twigs by breaking the leaves off of trees. Any tree will do.
* Open up the NatureCrafting window by pressing the `N` key (by default).
* Craft a Tool Stone using 2 stones. This should unlock a few new recipes.
* Craft an Axe-Hammer Head using 1 stone and the ToolStone.
* Craft the Crude Axe-Hammer using 1 stick, 1 twig, and the Axe-Hammer Head.
* Now, you'll be able to move onto gathering materials for building your first workstation.
    * There are other items like stone knives, clay hearths, and crude hoes, which you can craft using NatureCrafting.
    But, they are not necessary for progression.

**Building Your First Workstation**

* Select your newly crafted Crude Axe-Hammer.
* Cut down some trees to collect Wood Logs. Any kind of tree will do. You'll need at least 7 logs.
* Place 2 of those logs next to each other. Do not place any more than 2 next to each other, otherwise the next step
will not work.
* Use (AKA right-click) the Crude Axe-Hammer on the two logs. It should turn the 2 logs into a singular block with an axe
symbol on both squares. If so, you have built the workstation properly. You now have a Basic Woodcrafting Station.

**Crafting Items at the Workstation**

* Open the Basic Woodcrafting Station by walking up to it, aiming towards it, and pressing the interaction key
(`E` key by default).
* Move the Crude Axe-Hammer from your inventory into the tools slot.
* Move remaining logs from your inventory into the inputs slot.
* A new recipe category (`Materials`) should appear under the available recipes section.
* Click on the category to expand it.
* Under the expanded category, locate the crafting recipe for a Wooden Plank. It should require 1 wooden log and a
Crude Axe-Hammer to craft.
* Click on the craft button to craft it.
* In the output slot, there should be 2 Wooden Planks. Note that the durability of your Crude Axe-Hammer has been
reduced by 1 due to the previous action. Once the tool's durability reaches 0, it will be destroyed and removed from
your inventory. Almost all crafting recipes that require tools will decrease the tools' durabilities upon crafting.
* Keep crafting Wooden Planks until you have at least 10 of them.

*Optional*

If you wish to craft a slightly better axe-hammer, then do the following:

* Craft an Axe-Hammer Head (1 stone and a ToolStone) in the NatureCrafting window.
* Add 2 sticks, 1 twig, and the Axe-Hammer Head into the inputs slot of the Basic Woodcrafting Station.
* A new recipe category (`Tools`) should appear under the available recipes section.
* Click on the category to expand it.
* Under the expanded category, locate the crafting recipe for a Wooden Axe-Hammer. Click on the craft button.
* With the input items consumed, you should now see a Wooden Axe-Hammer in the output slot. This has a max durability of
25, which is an improvement from the Crude Axe-Hammer's max of 20.

**Upgrading Your Woodcrafting Station**

The Basic Woodcrafting Station is nice, but it can only craft items that require a Woodcrafting processLevel of 10 or
less. In order to build better and more complex items, you will need to upgrade the station. Here's how:

* Once you have at least 10 Wooden Planks, place them into the upgrade slot of the workstation.
* An upgrade button should appear to the right. Click on it.
* The workstation window should close, and the physical appearance of the workstation multiblock should change. You now
have a Novice Woodcrafting Station.
* Open up the workstation. The background image of the window itself has changed as well. On a functional level, you now
have double the slots for input ingredients (6) and tools (2), and can craft 2 more recipes that were not possible before.
    * Specifically, the Novice Woodcrafting Station supports up to a Woodcrafting process level of 20.

For most other workstations, you will follow a similar process of placing the required upgrade materials into the
upgrade slot, and initiating the upgrade process. For more information on what materials are needed for upgrading the
various workstations, consult the `InGameHelp` menu.

In order to progress onto the `Stonecrafting` tier of items, you'll need to first upgrade your Novice Woodcrafting
Station into the Standard Woodcrafting Station. For this, you'll need to acquire 20 Wooden Planks. Once you upgrade the
station, you should now have access to crafting Wooden Tables. Craft 2 of them at the workstation, and you will be all
set for starting progression in the `Stonecrafting` module.
